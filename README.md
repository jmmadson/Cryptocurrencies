# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
For this project, I took a set of cryptocurrency data with the intent to create a report that shows what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market, and how they could be grouped into a classification system to allow for easier investments.
 
To complete this, I preprocessed the data using Pandas and Python. From there I reduced the data dimensions by applying PCA to allow the data to be more easily visualized and processed. From there, I used Unsupervised Learning (K-means) to help predict the class that the various crypto currencies belonged to. As a final step for the report, I visualized the data in a 3D Scatter Plot, a data table and a 2D plot for consumption.
